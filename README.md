This page contains all the farming routes I made myself to use in combination with the Routes addon. Please note that you are NOT allowed to share my farming routes on the internet without my permission. I made these routes to help out the World of Warcraft community.

There are two ways how you can install these farming routes. There is a manual way and an automatic way. I stick with the automatic way to make things easier.

You can watch my video where I explain how you can import my farming routes automatically here: **https://youtu.be/ONdMZOPgmd4**.


## Written instructions
1) Download the 'Routes' and the 'Routes Import & Export' addons.
2) Download the farming route export string you would like to use in-game from my Github page.

3) To import a route copy the export string from the text file, open the "Routes" window (console command /routes) and select the "Routes" section. You can see a new Import text box.
